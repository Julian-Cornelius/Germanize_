    "I often think about my life, and about life in general.",
    "Most of the time I'm content, but sometimes difficult feelings arise.",
    "For example, when I hear that terrible things are happening in the world, like war or oppression.",
    "Often this makes me very sad, but I don't know where to put this sadness.",
    "I don't feel like it's allowed to express this sadness freely.",
    "Especially for me as a man.",
    "I think most people wouldn't be open to my sadness.",
    "I also often feel that most people aren't very honest.",
    "I think they are too afraid to be honest.",
    "That's why they behave the way they think is expected of them.",
    "They're afraid of being rejected.",
    "But I can understand that well - I'm like that too.",
    "But it also makes me sad.",
    "I also often wonder: What really is a good life?",
    "What is important in life?",
    "I believe our relationships are very important.",
    "Of course, also our relationship with ourselves.",
    "Maybe it's inevitable that there are always breaks and disappointments - in the family, at work, with friendsâ€¦ and also between groups like religions or nations.",
    "Maybe it's important to remember that we are all vulnerable and make mistakes.",
    "That we need each other.",
    "Maybe the world would be a better place if we allowed more space for our emotions - even for the difficult ones."
